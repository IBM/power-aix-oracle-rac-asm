# image: The name of the AIX image in PowerVC to be used for the provisioning.
# It should contain AIX version 7.2 or 7.3, the image_aix_version should be to the TL, such 7.3.1
# It should also have unzip rpm installed as well as all Oracle RAC required filesets installed.  
#      - These filesets are defined in a variable named aix_filesets in the vars/rac.yml vars file.
# Additionally the root password should be known.
# The image's rootvg disk no less than 50GB along with a 75GB disks to be used by the installer for oravg.
